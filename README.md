For a school project in Python, you need to create an application with the following functionality:

Socket Programming: Implement a server-client architecture.
JSON: Use JSON for writing in json format in filet.
File Writing: Include the ability to write data to files.
Threads: Utilize threads for handling multiple clients concurrently.
SQL: Store and retrieve data from an SQL database.
Tkinter GUI: Provide a graphical user interface using Tkinter.
Here's a structured outline of your project:

Project Overview
Objective:
Develop a Python application with a server-client architecture where the client can send data and specify an action to the server. The server will then perform the requested action, such as writing the data to an SQL table and retrieving all data from the table. The application will use sockets for communication, JSON for data formatting, threads for handling multiple clients, and Tkinter for the GUI.

Functionality Details
Client-Server Communication:

The client sends data and specifies the action using sockets.
The server listens for incoming client connections and handles requests.


File Operations:

The server can write data to files as specified by the client's request.
Multithreading:

The server uses threads to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, ensuring efficient and concurrent processing.
SQL Database Operations:

The server writes received data to an SQL table.
The server can retrieve all data from the SQL table and send it back to the client.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The client application includes a Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction, allowing users to send data and specify actions easily.
